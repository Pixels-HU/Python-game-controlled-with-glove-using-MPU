## Introduction
This is a simple Space invaders game based on the python open-source library pygame.

The game works as follows:

-The player moves the spaceship moves using his hand by moving it left and right and shoots bullets moving his hand up.

- The objective of the game is to survive enemy attacks trying to achieve the maximum score possible before the player dies.

- The player starts with a fixed number of lives, if an enemy hit a player, he loses a life

- A player is dead when he has no lives left.

-An extra lif and an extra laser clip appears every once in a while ready for player’s collection.

-Every 1000 score point a user gets an extra laser clip.
